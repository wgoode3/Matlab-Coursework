% You are to recreate the simulation in the atached .avi file (diceDemo.avi).
% It is a simulation of a dice roll that keeps track of:
% 1) How many times each number is rolled
% 2) The percentage of times each number is rolled
% 3) The total number of rolls
% 4) The maximum difference between consecutive percentages
% These values are displayed in the command window as shown in the demo
% video.  The dice is rolled in a figure window as shown in the demo video.
%
% (Note:
%     1) The video does not increment the counts and percentages properly, but does give a good example of the output your code should generate.
%     2) The image files that create the dice are .png files and are included in the directory.
% )
% Your simulation should be as close to the Demo as possible.
% - Name your function diceSimulation.m, take in no paremters and return
% nothing.  The chart of information should be displayed ans updated as in
% the demo.  The dice rolls should be animated as in the demo.
% - Use a random number function to generate the rolls of the dice
% - Use imshow, pause and refresh to animate the roll
% - Use the same technique to retrieve and display the dice as is used for cards in the deal.m file for poker extra credit
% - The rest is mostly fprintf and some vector computations
